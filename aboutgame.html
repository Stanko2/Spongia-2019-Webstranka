                <p>Welcome to the Naval transport simulator, commander!</p>
                <p>Your goal here is to build a great trading empire, with ships carrying various cargo to and from many different islands.</p>  
                <p>Each island has its own production rates for each of the ten types of cargo, but they have their own needs as well. </p>
                <p>Build ships, plan routes, earn money, unlock better ship parts, and repeat!</p>
                <p>Gain as much money as you can in about twenty minutes, then feel free to try again and improve! Or you can try endless mode.</p>  
                <p>Ships may sink, thus using the best parts is highly recommended</p>
